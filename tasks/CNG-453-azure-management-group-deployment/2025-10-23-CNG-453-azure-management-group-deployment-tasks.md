## Notes
- Follow Clean Architecture principles with clear separation of deployment logic, Azure integration, and Salt Security API communication
- Use existing patterns from subscription-level deployment scripts as reference for implementation consistency
- All Azure CLI operations should include comprehensive error handling and logging
- Leverage Azure RBAC inheritance feature for efficient permission deployment across management group hierarchies
- Integration with Salt Security backend API follows established patterns in existing codebase

## TDD Planning Guidelines
When generating tasks, follow Test-Driven Development (TDD) principles where feasible:
- **Test External Functions Only:** Tests should interact with public APIs, exported functions, and external interfaces. Never test internal implementation details.
- **Focus on Functionality:** Tests should verify behavior and functionality, not how the code works internal.
- **Module-Level Testing:** Tests should cover modules of code (single file or group of related files working together) as cohesive units.
- **Small Trackable Chunks:** Break modules into small, user-trackable tasks that alternate between test writing and implementation.
- **Continuous Test-Code Cycle:** Each chunk should follow: write test → implement code → write test → implement code (repeat for each small functionality within the module).
- **TDD When Feasible:** Apply TDD for business logic, algorithms, API endpoints, and complex functionality. Skip TDD for simple tasks like:
  - Entity/model creation (basic data structures)
  - Simple configuration files
  - Basic scaffolding or boilerplate code
  - Static content or styling-only components

## Tasks
- [ ] 1.0 **User Story:** As a Salt customer managing multiple Azure management groups, I want to deploy Salt Security scanning across all management groups so that I can enable comprehensive API and container security monitoring without per-subscription manual setup [8/0]
- [ ] 2.0 **User Story:** As a Salt Security support engineer, I want detailed deployment status and audit logs so that I can quickly troubleshoot any deployment issues [4/0]
- [ ] 3.0 **User Story:** As a Salt Security support engineer, I want automated cleanup on deployment failure so that failed deployments don't leave orphaned Azure resources [6/0]
- [ ] 4.0 **User Story:** As a Salt customer, I want input parameter validation and minimal permission verification so that I can confidently run deployment scripts with proper access controls [4/0]
- [ ] 5.0 **User Story:** As a Salt customer, I want a dedicated deletion script so that I can remove previously created Azure resources from specified management groups when needed [4/0]
- [ ] 6.0 **User Story:** As a Salt customer, I want comprehensive documentation and test plans so that I can understand the deployment process and validate successful implementation [2/0]
